    "text": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and early detection plays a crucial role in patient outcomes. In this project, we leverage deep learning with PyTorch to classify tumors as benign (0) or malignant (1) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.\nThrough data preprocessing, neural network modeling, and performance evaluation, we create a model that achieves a 98.25% accuracy in detecting malignancies."

    "text": "Nitrogen-16 is a short-lived radioactive isotope that decays into Oxygen-16 through beta decay. It’s commonly found in nuclear reactors and has a half-life of 7.13 seconds.\nRadioactive decay follows an exponential curve, but we can apply logarithmic transformation to make it linear so that we can use linear regression to work with the data.\nLet’s start with importing all the necessary libraries:\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nTranslating the mathematical formula into Python code:\nhalf_life = 7.13\ndecay_constant = torch.log(torch.tensor(2.0)) / half_life # λ = ln(2) / half-life (by definition)\ntime = torch.arange(0, 60, 1).unsqueeze(1) # let's pick a timeframe of 60 seconds\nA0 = 100 # initial activity (100%)\n\nradioactivity = A0 * torch.exp(-decay_constant * time) # exponential form\nlog_radio = torch.log(radioactivity) # linear form (applied .log)"
